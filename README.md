Quick Start
-----------------
#### Requirements
* GCC or Clang (C compiler)
* Git
* SDL2 library
* OpenGL development headers

#### Build
To build the project:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dmarshaq/game-in-c.git
   ```
3. Build using the NoBuild:
   ```
   gcc -o nob nob.c
   ./nob
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./bin/game
   ```

#### How to Run
- After building, launch the game using the compiled executable.

Features
-----------------
- Custom project build system using a meta-programming preprocessor and NoBuild tool.
- Dynamic asset manager allowing real-time loading and modification of game resources.
- Modular C codebase designed for scalability and reuse in future game projects.
- Low-level OpenGL graphics rendering for 2D interface and gameplay visuals.
- Focus on learning, experimentation, and building a robust foundation for game development.

About
-----------------
This project is both a 2D game and a framework for creating future games in C. It explores low-level systems programming, graphics programming with OpenGL, and asset management. The goal is to provide a flexible, reusable codebase while delivering a functional game that showcases core engine capabilities.
